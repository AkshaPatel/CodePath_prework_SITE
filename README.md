# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Aksha Patel**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/various-quiver-environment?path=script.js%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

    I used https://www.w3schools.com for help when I encountered the final portion of the project. I understood the logic behind the flow chart but I was having trouble visualizing it as code. So, to accomplish this task I used this website for reference on how to write JavaScript code.
2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

    In general, just coding with new languages made it challenging because I was unfamiliar with the syntax. I had to search up how to do something or how a portion of code functioned to understand its purpose and functionality. I had the most trouble with the last portion of the project where you had to handle the users guesses and determine if it was correct or false and execute the proper code based on what the user did. I understood the logic behind the flow chart, but being unfamiliar with JavaScript, I was unsure how to put it into code. The flow chart had a series of decisions which I understood translated into if and else statements, but my code was not working. I ran through it multiple times but the game did not function how I wanted it to. I was unfamiliar with how to use a debugger, so I just ran through the code in my head. In the end when I compared my code to that provided, I realized that instead of writing "guestCounter" in the first if statement, I only wrote "counter" which was the fault I had trouble picking up because I would think it was correct everytime I skimmed over it.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    I was wondering to what extent you could take CSS and HTML. I have seen modern looking websites and I wonder how you can use CSS and HTML to make them look so nice. Not only that but, I want to learn about backend coding with JavaScript. The different libraries like React and Angular and what they are used for. Can other languages be used for web-development? How about Python and C++? Can they be used in a similar way to JavaScript to code backend and along with frontend languages like HTML and CSS. The huge variety of languages and uses make it confusing for me because I am always asking myself: Which language should I learn first? Being a beginner in web-development can be overwhelming. However, I do understand that it is important to have knowledge of how code works conceptually, so going to computer science classes in college is important to form a good foundation to be a successful full stack web-developer.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

    First and foremost I would have done the optional features portion where you could add more buttons, speed it up, mix up the pattern, and add a timer. But, to add further onto the game, instead of randomly generating a pattern at the start of the game, I would randomly generate a new pattern at the start of every turn and make it so that the pattern increases in length by 1 each turn as it should. These implementations along with the optional features suggested by you would make the game difficult and appeal to more people. Being a full time college student and working made it difficult to make time to do this project, so if I had more time to work on it, I would implement these features to help showcase my enthusiasm to work on projects and learn new things.
